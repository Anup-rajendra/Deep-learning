# L1 Regularization
->I am using a popular dataset , such as the Iris dataset, and implement a linear regression model with L1 regularization using Python and scikit-learn. In this example, I'll use the Lasso regression model, which incorporates L1 regularization.

->In this example, I use the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, standardize the features, and then create a Lasso regression model with L1 regularization. The alpha parameter controls the strength of regularization.

->After fitting the model to the training data, I make predictions on the test set and evaluate the performance using Mean Squared Error. The coefficients of the model are then displayed, and you can observe that L1 regularization tends to shrink some coefficients towards zero, effectively performing feature selection.

->I use Matplotlib to create a plot of the coefficients. Each point on the plot represents the coefficient value for a specific feature. L1 regularization tends to push some coefficients to exactly zero, leading to sparse models, and this plot allows you to visualize the shrinkage effect.
